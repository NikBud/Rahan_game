Sweet aroma and an astonishing scent
A berry growing for eternities and counting
A rare grass, fit to be eaten by a traveler
A mindclearing plant, nice find for a traveler
The wizards also refer to them as space cakes
Growing on the sky islands, a rare delicacy
Honey produced by crystal bees, ancient subspecie
Growing under the tree of demiurge
Glimmers in the dark, that's the origin of a name
Probably the tasties sorbet you've ever had
